; The commands at the end of this file were primarily generated during a meeting with Professor LaBelle and Iver Cairns, in
; which we were trying to understand Chris' advice in an email to me, which was as follows:  

;"With regard to the asymmetry in the number of up/down currents â€“ Perhaps see what it looks like if you evaluate Jpara*dx for each event
;and total it for each orbit where dx is the distance along the s/c trajectory mapped to a common altitude. I think this is perhaps a
;better measure of current closure than counting the filaments. A comparison of this with the average value of |jpara*dx| would perhaps
;be meaningful. If not then it could be the current sheet geometry  that screws things up which is perhaps embedded in the database
;somehow from the correlation (or lack thereof) in dbx vs dby - Seem to remember something in there on this. "

; Haven't finished. Still need to 
; a) get the proper factor for mapping altitudes, and
; b) finish designing the output. One possibility is sketched in the "Header for the output file" below, but it's not coded yet.
