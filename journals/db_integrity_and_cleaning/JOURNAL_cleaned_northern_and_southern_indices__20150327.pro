; It seems like I'm always wishing I had a cleaned database to work with. Well, now I do! 

;For both southern and northern hemisphere, 
; charerange=[2,4e3]
; altituderange=[0,5000]
; satellite="OMNI"
; minILAT = 60 / -84  (Northern/Southern)
; maxILAT = 84 / -60  (Northern/Southern)

; Other cleaning happens in alfven_db_cleaner
; This includes ensuring that there are no indices associated with NaNs, infinities, or very extreme values for any quantities
; You might want to consider the restriction on extremely high values, however, because you could be excluding the "most
;   interesting" events.

; Still other cleaning happens in resize_maximus.pro, where all non-Alfven wave events (whatever
; they are) get excluded for being such disgusting creatures.

;First, the northern hemisphere
