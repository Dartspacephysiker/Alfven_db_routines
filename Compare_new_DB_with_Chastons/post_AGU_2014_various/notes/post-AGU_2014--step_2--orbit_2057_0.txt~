Chaston events 9,10 are the good ones

From 'less dflux_2030_0_as5_curthresh10microA_tdiff_0.016--time--AGU_mtg_w_Chaston.txt'
22   !1997-02-25/04:13:37.769, 1997-02-25/04:13:37.778,    9             17

Event 9 looks fine, no commentary

Event 10 looks fine as well; both are believable


HISTO COMMENTARY
****************
-->eflux
*Only 1 Dartmouth event showing for eflux?
*Numbers are similar for eflux
*We both have the ~365 eflux event
*Chaston has another ~600 eflux event

-->Poynting
*Hmmm... Even though Chaston has two events and we only have one (for 10microA thresh):
Chaston Poynting integral: 3.095*10^-4
Dart Poynting integral:    3.169*10^-4

*For 5 microA thresh:
Why such a large discrepancy?
Chast Poynting integral:  4.529*10^-4
Dart Poynting integral:   2.645*10^-3
